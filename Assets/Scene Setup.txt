When starting a scene:
1) Remove the Camera and Directional Light
2) Drag Landing Pad, Rocketship, Camera, Directional Light, and Background into hiearchy.
This should preserve our desired camera position and by having everything centered around the world origin changing the camera position
will be much easier in future.

Design Rules:
Center the landing pad at 0, 0, 1
Rocket Ship at 0, 2.5, 1
Main Camera at: 2.2, 6, -16 with a rotation of: 12, 0, 0

Things in the foreground such as the Rocketship and Landing/Launch Pads, and Hazards should be at z:1
