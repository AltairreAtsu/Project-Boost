At present for the Splash Effect to work one must have a seperate splash effect in scene and point the rocket at the object.

This is to avoid re-creating the object everytime we want to use it and to preserve it's rotation.
(If it was childed to the Rocketship it would move with it but also turn with it. Rotation is harder to correct for than a position. In the future this may changed)
